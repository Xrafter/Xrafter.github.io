      <center><h1><mark>How Apple Has So Many Buyers</mark></h1></center>
      <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;text-indent: 40px;"> 
Apple is a huge company that produces iphones, earbuds and computers. They captivate their audience with their power that comes from the devices they make. With all the competition from bigger companys like Dell, Microsoft, Samsung and other off-brand companys how come they have kept their head in the top of the game? Its because of the Apple Trap. 
The Apple Trap is a theory (Made By Me) that once a individual buy a apple phone, the next version either makes the buyer jealous of that version. Evidence to prove this will be the most recent Iphone, The Iphone X. Within the first week of its release it sold out in almost every apple store in the US. Carriers like <em style="color:red;">Sprint, MetroPCS, Verizon</em> have certain plans whenever a phone is released it will become "free" to the person subscribed to the plan.

          An employee assists customers looking at an Apple iPhone in <em><b>Khimki, Russia.</b></em> Walter Isaacson: Apple needs to innovate with a big new product <b style="color:green;"> 8:11 AM ET Tue, 2 May 2017 | 03:52 </b>There's one big reason people buy Apple products:the ecosystem. People don't buy iPhones by the tens of millions just because they like the hardware, though that's a huge part of it, but because they're tied into an ever-growing, sprawling ecosystem of software and services that allow you to do more with the products if you continue to invest in that ecosystem.Let me explain.
When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, iPod users who were already using iTunes saw something familiar and much more consumer-friendly than BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and Palm devices offered at the time. iTunes was the seed of an ecosystem that, in the past ten years, has grown into a towering elm.The App Store launched in 2008. After that, when people bought apps and games they were also continuing to buy into Apple. As they shelled out <u>$0.99 here and $1.99 there for new software that only ran on their Apple devices</u>, they were digging deeper into Apple's offering and further away from BlackBerry and a new operating system that was on the horizon: Android.
Apple continued to build out this ecosystem by changing the way its products interacted with one another. Apple added the ability to use iMessage and FaceTime from an iPad, for example, allowing you to carry on your iPhone conversations on a tablet. Then it introduced a similar feature to Macs, also adding in support for full phone calls. The more Apple devices you used, the better they worked together

So many times with projects that have to do with other tech companies, the goal is almost always based around the technology first, followed by whether or not people really want to use it. Geeky engineers are dazzled by the technology at their disposal and often create something because they can. But Apple’s approach is quite different. The engineers who are creating Apple products actually make them for themselves And Jobs was the chief “user” of Apple products when he was alive. All of Apple’s products are based on the fact that Jobs represented the real customer. And his engineers had to come to grips with that when designing a product. It has to be something that they personally couldn’t live without.</p></b>
